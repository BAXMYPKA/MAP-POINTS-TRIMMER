commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.trimXml=Deletes unnecessary whitespaces and line breaks from the xml body that makes the document inline.\nThis drastically shortens the file size and makes the reading and displaying data from points much faster.\nAs a separate option this makes inline only xml markup. All user descriptions will be untouched.\\This may be helpful if you are interested only in reading descriptions as it.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.trimDescription=Deletes unnecessary whitespaces and line breaks in user\u2019s desctiptions (those descriptions is presented as html markup within CDATA).\nIf a file contains a big amount of descriptions this option is drastically cut the overall size of document. Thus the processing and displaying data will be much faster especially in conjunction with trimming the whole xml-document.\nThis option as a separate condition may be helpful for reading document by eyes when you are interested in only xml markup to be examined.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.setPhotosPreview=If map point descriptions contain images they will be displayed as previews with the links to full size images.\nIt may be helpful to make preview as big as possible to show image details at a glance.\nThis size is set as width in percentage or pixels (the height will be computed automatically). For best results on mobile screens it is recommended to set ~86-100%. The width for desktop screens it is better to set in pixels (as usual) and the width is limited by your wishes.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.trimOutdatedPoiDesc=When exporting and reexporting point Locus Map produces a bunch of unnecessary info such as photo duplicates among descriptions in its format, excessive data etc.\nThis option is eliminating all those excessive data with outdated timestamps, tables duplicates etc. and leaves only the first ones from the moment of their creation.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.setPath=While exporting/importing map points with photos in .kmz archives you shouldn\u2019t change anything as usual as all the corresponding photos are placed in the \u201Cfiles\u201D folder near the points description file.\\But nevertheless you can replace those photos in any place on your computer and point out a new way to them.\nEven internet paths are available if you keep photo on a distant web server.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.pointsFile=For now only .kml and .kmz no more than 3GB are supported.\nBy default .kml file will be returned but if you load .kmz archive you can choose to return it with the processed .kml inside.\n.kml is a Google format for Google Earth or Google Map.\n.kmz is a simple archive (which can be opened and modified with any archiver for zip or rar) with the .kml file inside (\u201Cdoc.kml\u201D as usual) and a folder with corresponded photos (\u201Cfiles\u201D as usual).\nFor not so powerful computers the processing a huge .kmz files will take a longer time.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.path=If the file with points (.kml) you are going to pass from one application to another is placed near to a folder with corresponding images and that folder name for instance is 'files', so you can just write a relative type of path as "files".\nBut if you want to rename that folder as 'PhotoPOI' and keep it on drive 'C' in the 'MyPhotos' folder, so you have to write an absolute type of path as 'C:\\MyPhotos\\PhotoPOI'.
html.text.relativePath=Relative path
html.text.absolutePath=Absolute path
html.text.webPath=WEB path
exception.fieldError(2)=The field {0} contains error: {1}!
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.relativePath=The path to the folder with images relatively the file with their descriptions.\nIf that file (e.g. \u201Cdoc.kml\u201D) is placed near an images folder \u201CMyPhotos\u201D you can just write that folder name as it \u2013 \u201CMyPhotos\u201D.\nIf near your description file a folder \u201CMyPhotoPOI\u201D is placed and that folder contains the folder \u201CMyPhotos\u201D with corresponding images, so write \u201C/MyPhotoPOI/MyPhotos/\u201D.\nIf a folder with images is placed on a higher level and that higher folder name is \u201CRootFolder\u201D, write \u201C../RootFolder/MyPhotos/\u201D.\nBut if you are confused with all that stuff go Google and search for the \u201Crelative path\u201D.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.absolutePath=The full path to any directory within your local computer.\nFor example the folder with photos is named \u201Cfiles\u201D and placed on drive \u201CC:\u201D with the full path \u201CC:\\MyPOI\\GoogleEarth\\MyPhotoPOI\\files\u201D. So you can write exactly this path or just copy it from the address bar of that folder.\nTwo more examples: the full path to the folder in Your Documents for Windows 7/10 is \u201CC:\Users\\%username%\\Documents\\MyPhotoPOI\\files\u201D, and the full path to the installed Google Earth Pro for desktop is \u201CC:\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Google\\GoogleEarth\\files\u201D.\nAnd just a little clarification for experienced people (omit reading this if you are not): backslashes in windows-style paths will be automatically transformed into forward slashes as \u201CC:/Users/%username%/Documents/MyPhotoPOI/files/\u201D and you are free to write them that way. Also all whitespaces are allowed and will be substituted with \u201C%20\u201D sign.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.webPath=The path to photos through the Internet.\nIf you keep your images in a folder on a distant internet server, write an internet-address to it here. E.g. 'http://www.mysite.com/images/'
exception.kmzNoKml=No .kml file has been found in the {0}
commonMessages.article.howToUse=<p>The aim for this utility is to help with transferring your map points with photos in their descriptions from one program to another so that embedded photos will be properly displayed according to your wishes and screen resolution as preview, and also have the ability to be magnified by click.<br>Plus it proposes a few additional options.</p>\
<p>It may be helpful for people with a big amount of geo-tagged images within points who would keep them under control.</p>\
<p>First of all the utility supports transferring points between Locus Map pro and Google Earth Pro so that your points in Locus will be displayed as <img src=\u201D\u201D> and in Google Earth as <img src=\u201D\u201D></p>\
<p>At the moment it supports only .kml (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language">those are the files with the points (POI) description</a>) and .kmz (<a href=" https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmzarchives ">those are obvious archives which can be opened with any zip or rar archiver </a> with a points file .kml (named \u201Cdoc.kml\u201D as usual) and a folder with photos for that file (named "files" as usual).</p>\
<p>Below are some possible scenarios how to use this\u2026</p>
html.label.locusAsAttachments=Add as attachments in Locus Map Pro
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.asAttachmentInLocus=When importing points with photos into Locus Map to make images available in "Attachments" tab in the POIs properties.\nImages from Internet won't be available there.
html.label.locusParams=Set Locus Map&copy; specific parameters
html.label.loadPoi=Load custom points file
html.title.close=Close
html.title.select.downloadAsKmz=A full archive with photos and the processed .kml file inside.\nIt may take a longer time to process as it depends on amount of photos and a file size.
html.title.select.downloadAsKml=A processed file with the points and tracks inside.
html.h2.slogan=The handler for your custom POI with photos
html.text.openClose=Open/Close...
commonMessages.article.scenarios=<h3>From Locus Map Pro to Google Earth Pro on desktop</h3>\
<p>When exporting all your map points with photos to a .kmz archive you get a file which can be opened with any archiver for zip or rar.</p>\
<p>The photos from that .kmz you can keep in any place on computer by just extracting inner \u201Cfiles\u201D folder to any directory, e.g. in Documents "C:\Users\\%username%\\Documents\\MyPOI\\MapPhotos" or where the preinstalled Google Earth Pro is keeping all its data (for Windows 7\\10 it is "C:\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Google\\GoogleEarth\\files").</p>\
<p>The .kml file with map points has to be processed with Map Points Trimmer with pointing out the new way to photos and may be opened with Google Earth from any place.</p>\
\
<h4>If you want to make things more complicated</h4>\
<p>If you don\u2019t want to be puzzled just omit the following.<br>Google Earth Pro ignores relative paths to images from map points if they <i>are opened from whatever place</i> except GE default keeping place. Thus GE makes a big dump of files within that directory. But when placing the .kml into that default directory near the folder with corresponding images and point out just a plain relative way to them (\u201Cphotos\u201D if it is a folder with them) everything works as expected.\
\
<h3>From Locus Map back to Locus Map</h3>\
<p>If you would like your photos being visible right at the point description as a big preview for a link and may be opened by a click, instead of tabbing \u201CAttachments\u201D, so\u2026</p>\
<p>Export your favorite points from Locus Map with their descriptions as a .kmz archive, then process through Map Points Trimmer with \u201CPreview Size\u201D set as 100%, \u201CAdd as attachment in Locus\u201D and an absolute path to default Locus Map photo folder (as usual it has a path like "/storage/emulated/0/Locus/data/media/photo/" but it may vary depending on phone producer and OS version, check the properties and a full path to that folder in your case). The processed resulting .kml without photos file has to be imported back to Locus Map.</p>\
\
<h3>To change the path to photos in your phone</h3>\
<p>When creating point with photos for the first time Locus Map saves them into folder like "/storage/emulated/0/Locus/data/media/photo/" (the full path may vary depending on phone producer and OS version, check the properties of that folder in your case).<br>You would like to transfer all your photos to another place.</p>\
<p>After transferring photos you have to export your favorite points as a .kmz archive with the full descriptions. Then in Map Points Trimmer set an absolute type of path to a new folder and the resulting .kml has to be imported back to Locus Map.</p>\
\
<h3>Importing to Locus Map from another program</h3>\
<p>By default Locus Map saves its photos in a folder like "/storage/emulated/0/Locus/data/media/photo/". But when importing points from other .kmz archives every time it creates a new folder for photos in a special way.<br>\
With an addition of new portion of points with photos you would like those photos being kept within that controlled folder you are familiar with.</p>\
<p>So transfer new photos into that folder, load a .kml file into Map Points Trimmer and set an absolute type of way to that folder on phone. The resulting .kml has to imported to Locus Map.</p>\
\
<h3>Export to Google Maps</h3\
<p>(The description is under construction\u2026)</p>
