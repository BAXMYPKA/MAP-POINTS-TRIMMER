commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.clearOutdatedPoiDesc=After export and reexport points Locus Map often produces a bunch of unnecessary info such as photo duplicates among descriptions in its format, excessive data etc. This option is eliminating all those excessive data with outdated timestamps, tables duplicates etc. and leaves only the first ones from the moment of their creation.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.pointsTextOpacity=Points names text opacity in percentage terms.\n0 - name isn't visible, 100% - standard non-transparent visibility.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.pointsTextOpacityDynamic=Points names text opacity when the mouse cursor is over them (in percentage terms).\n0 - name isn't visible, 100% - standard non-transparent visibility.

commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.pointsTextHexColorDynamic=Points names text color when the mouse cursor is over them.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.pointsIconSize=Points icons size in percentage terms from 0 to 300%.\n0 - makes icons not visible (use this option if you would like to hide them from map). 100% is the default icons size for your current screen (and it is big enough as usual).
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.pointsIconSizeDynamic=Points icons size when the mouse cursor is over them.\nPoints icons size in percentage terms from 0 to 300%.\n0 - makes icons not visible (use this option if you would like to hide them from map). 100% is the default icons size for your current screen (and it is big enough as usual)

commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.trimXml=It deletes unnecessary whitespaces and line breaks from the xml body that makes the document inline.\nThis drastically shortens the file size and makes the reading and displaying data from points much faster.\nAs a separate option this makes inline only xml markup. All user descriptions will be untouched.\nThis may be helpful if you are interested only in reading descriptions as it.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.trimDescription=It deletes unnecessary whitespaces and line breaks in user\u2019s descriptions (those descriptions are presented as html markup within CDATA).\nIf a file contains a big amount of descriptions this option is drastically cut the overall size of the document. Thus the processing and displaying data will be much faster especially in conjunction with trimming the whole xml-document.\nThis option as a separate condition may be helpful to read document by eyes when you are interested in only xml markup to be examined.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.setPhotosPreview=If map point descriptions contain images they will be displayed as previews with the links to full size images.\nIt may be helpful to make preview as big as possible to show image details at a glance.\nThis size is set as width in percentage or pixels (the height will be computed automatically). For best results on mobile screens it is recommended to set ~86-100%. The width for desktop screens it is better to set in pixels (as usual) and the width is limited by your wishes.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.setPath=While exporting/importing map points with photos in .kmz archives as a rule you shouldn\u2019t change anything as all the corresponding photos are placed in the \u201Cfiles\u201D folder near the points description file.\nBut nevertheless you can replace those photos in any place on your computer and point out a new way to them.\nEven internet paths are available if you keep photos on a distant web server.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.pointsFile=For now only .kml and .kmz no more than 3GB are supported.\nBy default .kml file will be returned but if you load .kmz archive you can choose to return it with the processed .kml inside.\n.kml is a Google format for Google Earth or Google Map.\n.kmz is a simple archive (which can be opened and modified with any archiver for zip or rar) with the .kml file inside (\u201Cdoc.kml\u201D as usual) and a folder with corresponded photos (\u201Cfiles\u201D as usual).\nFor not so powerful computers the processing a huge .kmz files will take a longer time.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.path=If a file with points (.kml) you are going to pass from one application to another is placed near to a folder with corresponding images and that folder name for instance is 'files', so you can just write a relative type of path as "files".\nBut if you want to rename that folder as 'PhotoPOI' and keep it on drive 'C' in the 'MyPhotos' folder, so you have to write an absolute type of path as 'C:\\MyPhotos\\PhotoPOI'.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.googleEarthDynamicParameters=How to display icons and text when the mouse cursor is over them.\nE.g. not to overly map with a lot of icons and texts you can set the static display with quite small icons without text and those icons will zoom in and a text will shown only under the mouse cursor.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.googleEarthStaticParameters=All icons and texts will have static display on map according to the following settings.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.presets=All your input data as locally saved presets.\nJust enter a preset name and save it for the future use.\nMax number of presets is 4.
html.text.relativePath=Relative path

html.text.about=About
html.text.open-close=Show\\Hide
exception.fieldError(2)=The field {0} contains error: {1}!
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.relativePath=The path to an images folder which placed relatively to the description file.\nIf that file (e.g. \u201Cdoc.kml\u201D) is placed near a folder \u201CMyPhotos\u201D you can just write that folder name as it \u2013 \u201CMyPhotos\u201D.\nIf near your description file there is a folder \u201CMyPhotoPOI\u201D and that folder contains the folder \u201CMyPhotos\u201D with corresponding images, so write \u201C/MyPhotoPOI/MyPhotos/\u201D.\nIf a folder with images is placed on a higher level and that higher folder name is \u201CRootFolder\u201D, write \u201C../RootFolder/MyPhotos/\u201D.\nBut if you are confused with all that stuff go Google and search for the \u201Crelative path\u201D.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.absolutePath=The full path to any directory within your local computer\nFor example the folder with photos is named \u201Cfiles\u201D and placed on drive \u201CC:\u201D with the full path \u201CC:\\MyPOI\\GoogleEarth\\MyPhotoPOI\\files\u201D. So you can write exactly this path or just copy it from the address bar of that folder.\nTwo more examples: the full path to the folder in Your Documents for Windows 7/10 is \u201CC:\\Users\\%username%\\Documents\\MyPhotoPOI\\files\u201D, and the full path to the installed Google Earth Pro for desktop is \u201CC:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Google\\GoogleEarth\\files\u201D.\nAnd just a little clarification for experienced people (omit reading this if you are not): backslashes in windows-style paths will be automatically transformed into forward slashes as \u201CC:/Users/%username%/Documents/MyPhotoPOI/files/\u201D and you are free to write them that way. Also all whitespaces are allowed and will be substituted with \u201C%20\u201D sign.
commonMessages.interrogationAsDescription.webPath=The path to photos through the Internet.\nIf you keep your images in a folder on a distant internet server, write the internet-address to it here. E.g. 'http://www.mysite.com/images/'

commonMessages.article.scenarios=<h3>From Locus Map Pro to Google Earth Pro on desktop</h3><p>When your export all your map points with photos to a .kmz archive you get a file which can be opened with any archiver for zip or rar.</p><p>You can keep the photos from that .kmz in any place on a computer by just extracting inner \u201Cfiles\u201D folder to any directory, e.g. in Documents "C:\\Users\\%username%\\Documents\\MyPOI\\MapPhotos" or where the preinstalled Google Earth Pro keeps all its data (for Windows 7\\10 it is "C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Google\\GoogleEarth\\files").</p><p>The .kml file with map points has to be processed with Map Points Trimmer with pointing out the new way to photos and may be opened with Google Earth from any place.</p><h4>If you want to make things more complicated</h4><p>If you don\u2019t want to be puzzled just skip the following.<br>Google Earth Pro ignores relative paths to images from map points if they <i>are opened from whatever place</i> except GE default keeping place. Thus GE makes a big dump of files within that directory. But when placing the .kml into that default directory near the folder with corresponding images and pointing out just a plain relative way to them (\u201Cphotos\u201D if it is a folder with them) everything works as expected.<h3>From Locus Map back to Locus Map</h3><p>If you would like your photos to be visible right at the point description as a big preview for a link and may be opened by a click, instead of tabbing \u201CAttachments\u201D, so\u2026</p><p>Export your favorite points from Locus Map with their descriptions as a .kmz archive, then process through Map Points Trimmer with \u201CPreview Size\u201D set as 100%, \u201CAdd as attachment in Locus\u201D and an absolute path to default Locus Map photo folder (as usual it has a path like "/storage/emulated/0/Locus/data/media/photo/" but it may vary depending on phone producer and OS version, check the properties and a full path to that folder in your case). The processed resulting .kml without photos file has to be imported back to Locus Map.</p><h3>To change the path to photos in your phone</h3><p>Locus Map saves the photos into a folder like "/storage/emulated/0/Locus/data/media/photo/" (the full path may vary depending on phone producer and OS version, check the properties of that folder in your case) creating point with photos for the first time.<br>You would like to transfer all your photos to another place.</p><p>After transferring photos you have to export your favorite points as a .kmz archive with the full descriptions. Then in Map Points Trimmer set an absolute type of path to a new folder and the resulting .kml has to be imported back to Locus Map.</p><h3>Importing to Locus Map from another program</h3><p>By default Locus Map saves its photos in a folder like "/storage/emulated/0/Locus/data/media/photo/". But every time it creates a new folder for photos in a special way importing points from other .kmz archives.<br>With an addition of new portion of points with photos you would like those photos being kept within that controlled folder you are familiar with.</p><p>So transfer new photos into that folder, load a .kml file into Map Points Trimmer and set an absolute type of way to that folder on phone. The resulting .kml has to be imported to Locus Map.</p><h3>Export to Google Maps</h3><p>(The description is under construction)</p>
commonMessages.about=<p>Initially this program has been developed as a private utility for quick transformation of my map points before transferring them between Locus Map Pro and Google Earth Pro on desktop forth and back.</p><p>Then it was added with some more features and I decided to make a design and let others to use it as it may be helpful for someone.</p><p>Ideally all this has to be made as a separate site page on a server but I\u2019m not interested in having a hosting and for now the utility is being proposed as it is.<br>That\u2019s why it is rather demanding to computer resources.</p><p>In progress:<br><ul><li>Support for .gpx format. This is the doubtful feature for me as .gxp is developed not enough for supporting images.</li></ul><p>
