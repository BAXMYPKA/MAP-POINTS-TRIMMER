# MAP POINTS TRIMMER
**The convenient handler for your map points with photos**

The aim of this utility is to help transfer your map points with photos in their descriptions from one program to another one so that embedded photos will be properly displayed according to your wishes and screen resolution as preview and have the ability to be magnified by click. Also you can set any path to your photos within any device, delete outdated garbage from descriptions and so forth.

Also it proposes a few additional options.

You can set a desired preview size, delete the unnecessary garbage from descriptions, set any path to all your photos etc.

First of all it's been developed for Locus Map Pro and Google Earth Pro for desktop.
Examples:

  <img src="../static/img/locusScreenshot420x700.jpg" width="420" alt="Locus Map Pro point with photo" title="Locus Map Pro point with photo">
  <img src="img/GEscreenshot1060x700.jpg" width="800" alt="Google Earth Pro photo display" title="Google Earth Pro photo display">

## How to use it
Download the ready to use [application here](https://github.com/BAXMYPKA/MAP-POINTS-TRIMMER/releases/download/v1.0/MAP-POINTS-TRIMMER.zip).

When the application start use your browser to visit: [Map-Points-Trimmer](http://localhost:8088/trimmer/) (http://localhost:8088/trimmer/)

**After you finish don't forget to shut down the application with a special button!** (Otherwise the local server will hang in your RAM.)

For the moment the utility supports only .kml and .kmz formats as the most powerful for keep and transfer points with photos.

The support of .gpx format is being considered but I'm hesitating if it will be useful.
